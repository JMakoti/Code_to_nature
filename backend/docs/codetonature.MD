# 🌱 Code-to-Nature

**Touch grass. Write code. Find balance.**

---

## 📌 Problem

Developers spend long hours in front of screens, leading to:

* 🪑 Sedentary habits and low physical activity
* 🧠 Burnout and declining mental well-being
* 🌍 Disconnection from nature and ecological balance

---

## 💡 Hypothesis

If we connect **coding productivity** with **outdoor activity**, then:

* Developers will be motivated to adopt healthier routines
* Screen time and nature time will balance out
* A community of eco-aware developers can emerge

---

## ✅ Solution

**Code-to-Nature** is a gamified platform where coding hours become **eco-credits**, which can only be unlocked by real-world outdoor activities.

### 🔄 How It Works

1. **Code** → Log coding sessions (manual entry or GitHub integration)
2. **Earn Locked Credits** → Productivity points are generated but locked
3. **Go Outside** → Verify activities like walking, hiking, cycling, or gardening
4. **Unlock Eco-Credits** → Outdoor activities release usable credits
5. **Redeem Rewards** → Spend eco-credits on perks, discounts, or community goods
6. **Compete** → Leaderboards and challenges keep it fun
